## Keybindings

### Vehicles – View

| Keybinding                          | Input Device Type |
| ----------------------------------  | ----------------- |
| Cicle camera view[^4]               | key[0]            |
| Cicle camera orbit mode             | key[1]            |
| Zoom in (3rd person view)           | slide_pot[0][^1]  |
| Zoom out (3rd person view)          | slide_pot[0][^1]  |

[^1]: This is a potentiometer that is not circular, it is in line
[^2]: This one must be tried to see what difference it has with the other zoom.
[^3]: This must be tried because it seems to change the zoom mode.

[^4]: This is activated by holding the `F4` key
[^5]: This is activated by holding the `Z` key
[^5]: Why do they use the same key save and load?
[^6]: FOV (field of view) or field of vision, is related to the focal length.
[^7]: DOF (depth of field) depth of field.
[^8]: What is PH?
